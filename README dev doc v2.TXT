Build A Computer for Kids



PROJECT TITLE: BACK (build a computer for kids)


PURPOSE OF PROJECT: design a game that teaches early learners the basics of computer building
This game will show children that it isnt as scary as they may think to build a computer.
They will be guided through a series of parts they are able to drag toward the computer.
Once the part is in the correct spot the idea is to have a message come up telling about the part.


VERSION or DATE: 2.0 this is from the second prototype mostly. 

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: hit run and splash screen is up; press enter to beging.  I hope to add a discription of what to do tonite to that screen.


AUTHORS: Tristan and Kevin



INSTRUCTIONS: parts can be clicked and moved. so far no banners or anything flashy. have a sound file but it keeps over executing.
